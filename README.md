"# API-Authentication" 

This Project is to work on different API Authentication methods such as
   1) NO Authentication
   2) Basic Authentication
   3) API Key Authorization
   4) Token Based Authentication

-> It mainly deals with implementing the above methods using ExpressJs and Axios( for network calls ).

-> User Interface

-> It simply displays the fetched API response with different Authentication.

Ex: when API key button triggers, it uses API Key Authorization and access data.
